This was a project for an internet programming class.

The requirements:
- an input box and submit button
- a button to complete the task
- a button to remove the task
- the task text should change (be greyed out) when the "complete task" button is pressed

In addition to the above requirements, I added the feature of the buttons being greyed out, in addition to the text, when the "complete button" is pressed.

Everything after the intial commit is just me messing around with CSS and JS to make the page look cooler!
